# Palestine Project
This project revolves around exposing the inequalites and exploitation of Palestinian people's human rights and land.

# Theme  

The key concept of this project is to gather visual data (videos and other types of footage) and reorganize it into a narrative informative video about the current injustices and chaos in Gaza.
My key source of inspiration emerged from the BBC News coverage online 

# Mechanics  

Users can follow the video guided by the narration.

# Aims  

The main aim of the project is to spread awareness about the Israel- Palestine conflict.

# Aesthetics

A Yotube Video should be produced
