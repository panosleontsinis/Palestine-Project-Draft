# Israel-Palestine Project
This project revolves around the issues faced when trying to produce a news coverage video on the YouTube interface. Providing my personal opinion on how news videos should be broadcasted as well as exploring other similar digital intefaces and their approach on covering the Israel-Palestine conflict

# Theme  

The key concept of this project is to gather visual data (videos and other types of footage) and reorganize it into a narrative informative video about the current injustices and chaos in Gaza. My key source of inspiration emerged from the BBC News coverage online and other news outlets broadcasts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

# Narrative Pacing/Mechanics  
The pacing of the video is not yet adjusted. Different methods need to be implemented in order to keep users entertained and engaged with the content. The rythm of the AI voice can be adjusted using the Synthesys AI Studio software which I already have been gettting in grip with. Better transitions are also considered in order to create a more smooth video whereby it would add value to the overall product. Despite the fact that the video is not yet sunchronised with the audio. I believe the the prototype provides a clear future preception of how the project can conclude
# Aims/Interactive aspects  

The main aim of the project is to spread awareness about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Educating audiences within the younger generation (Z) through social media content is an efficient material as the content produced is interactive and provides entertaining historical data. Within such a sensitive period of war and conflict, it is important to explore the Palestinian people's struggles as well as shed light on humanitarian concerns. Other benefits arise such as spreading accurate information on such a sensitive topic.
Interactive aspects of my project vary from:
1. Timestamps within the video - allows users to enjoy a customized/tailored experience whereby they can filter out content they may find sensitive/less interested
2. Annotation
3. Comments section - audiences can share their opinions of the video and create further areas of discussion
4. Social media integrated - could generate international support through the instagram page

# Aesthetics
A Youtube Video should be produced narrating the led-up to the Israeli-Palestine conflict up to the current date.
