# Israel-Palestine Project
This project revolves around the issues faced when trying to produce a news coverage video on the YouTube interface. Providing my personal opinion on how news videos should be broadcasted as well as exploring other similar digital intefaces and their approach on covering the Israel-Palestine conflict

# Theme  
Although the theme of my project appears very simplistic, it includes a voiceover, other news interfaces,researched websites relevant to the production and distribution of news coverage data.

# Aims/Interactive aspects  
Explores how digital interfaces produce, mediate, and distribute knowledge (images, text, sound, facts) about the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. These interfaces include (this is up to you - explain exactly what each is/does) video editing software, automated AI speech generation, social media platform.  Pay particular attention to the interfaces you use and their specific components (edit buttons, cut/paste)

Interactive aspects of my project vary from:
- Comments section - audiences can share their opinions of the video and create further areas of discussion
- Social media integrated - could generate international support through the instagram page


# Aesthetics
The YouTube video produces provides a monotone throughout in order to maintain the seriousness and highlight the significance of the content covered. the target audience would prefer a relaxing and simplistic aesthetic throughout the video.
