# Israel-Palestine Project
This project revolves around exposing the inequalities and exploitation of Palestinian people's human rights and land over recent years.
# Theme  

The key concept of this project is to gather visual data (videos and other types of footage) and reorganize it into a narrative informative video about the current injustices and chaos in Gaza. My key source of inspiration emerged from the BBC News coverage online and other news outlets broadcasts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

# Narrative Pacing/Mechanics  

Users can follow the video guided by the narration. The comments section will create areas of discussion where the project leader can interact with the audience.
# Aims/Interactive aspects  

The main aim of the project is to spread awareness about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Educating audiences within the younger generation (Z) through social media content is an efficient material as the content produced is interactive and provides entertaining historical data. Within such a sensitive period of war and conflict, it is important to explore the Palestinian people's struggles as well as shed light on humanitarian concerns. Other benefits arise such as spreading accurate information on such a sensitive topic.
Interactive aspects of my project vary from:
1. Timestamps within the video - allows users to enjoy a customized/tailored experience whereby they can filter out content they may find sensitive/less interested
2. Annotation
3. Comments section - audiences can share their opinions of the video and create further areas of discussion
4. Social media integrated - could generate international support through

# Aesthetics
A Youtube Video should be produced narrating the led-up to the Israeli-Palestine conflict up to the current date.
